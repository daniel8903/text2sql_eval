This helps determine how many returning customers there were for each month.\n\n- **returning_customer_orders**: Counts orders made by customers whose `first_order_date` is before 2021 and whose `last_order_date` falls within 2021, grouped by month.\n\nFinally, the main query combines these results to provide a monthly breakdown of new customer orders, returning customer orders, and total orders for each month in 2021.

If there is no previous budget (i.e., it's the first record for that category), the increase is considered as 0.\n\n- **Final Query**: The main query aggregates these increases by `category`, sums them up, and orders the results in descending order to find the top three categories with the highest total budget increases.
