The user wants to find drugs with rare diseases indication and their total sales that are greater than the average sales for infectious diseases. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to check the schema. There are two tables: sales and drugs. The sales table has drug_id, quarter, year, revenue. Drugs has id, name, company, indication.\n\nSo, the plan is: \n\n1. Join sales and drugs on drug_id to get the indication for each sale.\n2. Calculate total sales per drug for rare diseases. Wait, but the question says \"drugs and their respective total sales for rare diseases indication\". So, first, filter the drugs where indication is 'Rare_Diseases'. Then sum their sales.\n\nBut then, compare that total to the average sales for infectious diseases. Wait, the average sales for infectious diseases would be the average of all sales where the indication is 'Infectious_Diseases'? Or is it the average per drug? The question says \"average sales for infectious diseases\", so probably the average of all sales in that indication.\n\nWait, the question says \"sales greater than the average sales for infectious diseases\". So, the total sales for each rare disease drug must be greater than the average sales value of infectious disease sales.\n\nWait, but how is the average calculated? Let me think. For infectious diseases, we need to compute the average revenue per sale? Or the average total sales per drug? The wording is a bit ambiguous. But the question says \"average sales for infectious diseases\", which might mean the average of all sales (revenue) entries where the indication is infectious diseases. So, for example, if there are multiple sales entries for infectious disease drugs, take their average revenue.\n\nBut the user's question is about total sales for rare disease drugs. So, first, for each rare disease drug, compute their total sales (sum of revenue across all their sales entries). Then compare that total to the average sales (average revenue) of infectious disease sales.\n\nWait, but that might not make sense. Because the average sales for infectious diseases could be a single number, and the total sales for rare disease drugs would be compared to that number.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n- Compute the average revenue for all sales entries where the drug's indication is 'Infectious_Diseases'. Let's call this avg_infectious.\n\n- Then, for drugs with indication 'Rare_Diseases', compute their total sales (sum of revenue across all their sales entries), and filter those where the total is greater than avg_infectious.\n\nBut how to do that in SQL?\n\nFirst, need to get the average for infectious diseases. That would be a subquery. Then, join the drugs and sales tables, group by drug, sum the revenue, and compare to that average.\n\nBut need to make sure that the drugs are only those with 'Rare_Diseases' indication.\n\nSo, the SQL would be something like:\n\nSELECT d.name, SUM(s.revenue) AS total_sales\nFROM sales s\nJOIN drugs d ON s.drug_id = d.id\nWHERE d.indication = 'Rare_Diseases'\nGROUP BY d.id, d.name\nHAVING SUM(s.revenue) > (\n    SELECT AVG(s2.revenue)\n    FROM sales s2\n    JOIN drugs d2 ON s2.drug_id = d2.id\n    WHERE d2.indication = 'Infectious_Diseases'\n);\n\nWait, but what if there are no sales for infectious diseases? Then the average would be NULL, but the question probably assumes that there are some. Also, need to make sure that the subquery returns a single value.\n\nBut according to the schema, the drugs table has an indication column. So, the subquery is selecting the average revenue from sales where the drug's indication is infectious diseases.\n\nBut the user's question says \"sales greater than the average sales for infectious diseases\". So, the total sales for each rare disease drug must be greater than the average sales (average revenue) of infectious disease sales.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nNow, check if the tables have the necessary columns. The sales table has revenue, and drugs has indication. So, the join is correct.\n\nBut in the sample data, the drugs table has only one entry with indication 'Rare_Diseases'. The infectious diseases would be another entry. But the sample data doesn't have that. But the SQL should work regardless.\n\nSo, the final SQL is as above. Let me check for syntax errors. The HAVING clause uses SUM(revenue) > subquery. The subquery is a scalar.\n\nYes, that should work. Also, the GROUP BY includes d.id and d.name, which is necessary because in some SQL dialects, you have to group by all non-aggregated columns. Since the drugs.id is the primary key, grouping by id and name (assuming name is unique per drug) is correct.\n\nBut in standard SQL, if you group by d.id, you can have d.name in the select list because it's functionally dependent on the id. However, some SQL implementations require grouping by all columns in the select. So, to be safe, group by d.id, d.name.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the SQL should be as written.\n</think>\n\n```sql\nSELECT d.name, SUM(s.revenue) AS total_sales\nFROM sales s\nJOIN drugs d ON s.drug_id = d.id\nWHERE d.indication = 'Rare_Diseases'\nGROUP BY d.id, d.name\nHAVING SUM(s.revenue) > (\n    SELECT AVG(s2.revenue)\n    FROM sales s2\n    JOIN drugs d2 ON s2.drug_id = d2.id\n    WHERE d2.indication = 'Infectious_Diseases'\n);\n```", "latency_sec": 33.32801699638367, "total_duration_sec": 33.236282143, "load_duration_sec": 6.214765316, "tokens_prompt": 214, "prompt_eval_sec": 0.168804817, "tokens_completion": 1191, "completion_eval_sec": 26.844805329, "tokens_total": 1405, "tokens_per_sec": 42.15672358041742, "match_exact": false, "match_ast": false, "llm_equivalent": false, "llm_explanation": "The Reference SQL includes 's.drug_id' in the SELECT clause, while the Generated SQL does not.

The user is asking for users who used electric vehicles and their trip details. So I need to find a way to connect the users table with the trips table through the vehicles table. \n\nFirst, the vehicles table has a column is_electric which is a boolean. So I need to filter vehicles where is_electric is true. Then, the trips table has a vehicle_id that links to the vehicles table's id. So joining trips and vehicles on vehicle_id = id. Then, joining users with trips on user_id = id.\n\nSo the tables involved are users, vehicles, and trips. The columns needed from users are name, maybe id, and other details. From trips, trip_distance, trip_duration, departure_time, arrival_time. From vehicles, maybe just the is_electric to filter.\n\nSo the SQL statement would start with SELECT users.name, and then the trip details from trips. Then JOIN vehicles ON trips.vehicle_id = vehicles.id, and JOIN users ON trips.user_id = users.id. Then WHERE vehicles.is_electric = true.\n\nWait, the question says \"users who used electric vehicles and their trip details\". So the trip details are part of the result. So the SELECT clause should include all the trip details. Let me check the columns in trips: id, user_id, vehicle_id, trip_distance, trip_duration, departure_time, arrival_time. So maybe include all those except user_id and vehicle_id if they are not needed, but the question says \"trip details\" which might mean all those columns.\n\nBut the user might want the user's name and the trip details. So the SELECT would be users.name, trips.trip_distance, trips.trip_duration, trips.departure_time, trips.arrival_time. Also, maybe the user's other details like age, gender, city if needed, but the question doesn't specify. The question says \"who are the users\" so probably name is sufficient, but maybe other details are also needed. However, the example in the context has the user with id 3, name Alex, etc. But the question is to list the users and their trip details. So perhaps the user's name and the trip details.\n\nSo the SQL would be:\n\nSELECT users.name, trips.trip_distance, trips.trip_duration, trips.departure_time, trips.arrival_time\nFROM users\nJOIN trips ON users.id = trips.user_id\nJOIN vehicles ON trips.vehicle_id = vehicles.id\nWHERE vehicles.is_electric = true;\n\nBut wait, the user might want all the trip details, so maybe include all columns from trips. But the exact columns to select? The question says \"trip details\" which is vague, but the example in the context has trip_distance, trip_duration, departure_time, arrival_time. So maybe those are the key details. Also, maybe the vehicle_type from vehicles? But the question is about users who used electric vehicles, so maybe the vehicle_type is not needed unless specified.\n\nBut the user's question is to get the users and their trip details. So the trip details would be the columns from the trips table. However, the exact columns to select are not specified, but the example in the context includes trip_distance, trip_duration, departure_time, arrival_time. So perhaps selecting those.\n\nBut the SQL should be as per the user's question. Since the user says \"trip details\", maybe all columns from trips. However, the problem says to use standard ANSI SQL and refer only to tables present. So the answer should select the necessary columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants all the columns from the trips table and the user's name. So the SQL would be:\n\nSELECT users.name, trips.*\nFROM users\nJOIN trips ON users.id = trips.user_id\nJOIN vehicles ON trips.vehicle_id = vehicles.id\nWHERE vehicles.is_electric = true;\n\nBut using trips.* might not be allowed if the problem expects explicit column names. However, the problem says to use standard ANSI SQL, and using * is allowed. However, in practice, it's better to specify columns. But since the user hasn't specified which columns, maybe using * is acceptable. However, looking at the example in the context, the INSERT into trips has values for trip_distance, trip_duration, departure_time, arrival_time. So maybe the trip details are those four columns. So the answer should select those.\n\nBut the problem says to translate the question into a single SQL statement. The user's question is \"Who are the users who used electric vehicles and their trip details?\" So the answer should include the user's name and the trip details. The trip details would be the columns from the trips table. However, the exact columns are not specified, but the example in the context includes trip_distance, trip_duration, departure_time, arrival_time. So perhaps selecting those.\n\nAlternatively, the answer could select all columns from trips and users. But the user might not need all columns. However, since the problem says to use standard ANSI SQL and refer only to tables present, the answer should be correct.\n\nAnother point: the user's name is in the users table, and the trip details are in the trips table. So the SQL should join users and trips via user_id, and vehicles via vehicle_id. Then filter where is_electric is true.\n\nSo the correct SQL would be:\n\nSELECT users.name, trips.trip_distance, trips.trip_duration, trips.departure_time, trips.arrival_time\nFROM users\nJOIN trips ON users.id = trips.user_id\nJOIN vehicles ON trips.vehicle_id = vehicles.id\nWHERE vehicles.is_electric = true;\n\nBut maybe also include the vehicle's id or type? The question is about users who used electric vehicles, so the vehicle's type is already known to be electric. But the user might not need that. The trip details are the trip's data.\n\nSo the answer should be as above. Let me check the sample data. In the context, there's a user with id 3, name Alex, and a trip with id 3, user_id 3, vehicle_id 1. The vehicle with id 1 is Tesla, is_electric true. So the query should return Alex's name and the trip details (distance 15.3, duration 25, departure and arrival times). So the SQL should return that.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\n```sql\nSELECT users.name, trips.trip_distance, trips.trip_duration, trips.departure_time, trips.arrival_time\nFROM users\nJOIN trips ON users.id = trips.user_id\nJOIN vehicles ON trips.vehicle_id = vehicles.id\nWHERE vehicles.is_electric = true;\n```", "latency_sec": 30.990307092666626, "total_duration_sec": 30.790733843, "load_duration_sec": 0.028721769, "tokens_prompt": 316, "prompt_eval_sec": 0.05513637, "tokens_completion": 1350, "completion_eval_sec": 30.703706108, "tokens_total": 1666, "tokens_per_sec": 53.75874446866107, "match_exact": false, "match_ast": false, "llm_equivalent": false, "llm_explanation": "The queries are not semantically equivalent.

Since it's a single column, I can use the ORDER BY clause to sort the total_sales_2022 in descending order and then limit the result to 1 row. Alternatively, I could use a subquery with MAX, but ordering and limiting seems more straightforward here.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple customers with the same maximum sales? The question says \"the top customer,\" which might imply a single one. However, the schema doesn't have any information about ties. The answer might return one customer even if there's a tie, depending on the database's handling.

So, to get the vehicle model for each trip, I need to join these two tables on vehicle_id.\n\nRight, so the first step is to join Trips and ElectricVehicleModels using vehicle_id. Then, for each vehicle model, I need to find the maximum distance. That means using the MAX() function on the distance column.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that the vehicle_id in Trips exists in ElectricVehicleModels.

And Ingredient_Categories with ingredient_id and ingredient_category. So I need to join these two tables on ingredient_id.\n\nWait, the quantity is per sale and ingredient. But how do I aggregate the total quantity per category? Maybe sum the quantity for each category. Then divide by the total quantity across all categories to get the percentage.\n\nLet me think. First, join Sales_Details with Ingredient_Categories. Then group by ingredient_category. For each group, sum the quantity. Then, calculate each group's sum divided by the total sum of all quantities, multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nBut how to handle the total sum? Maybe use a subquery to compute the total quantity. Or use a window function. Let's see. If I do a SUM(quantity) OVER() as total, then in each row, I can have the total. Then, for each category, (sum_quantity / total) * 100.\n\nAlternatively, compute the total in a subquery. Let me try the window function approach. Let's structure the SQL:\n\nSELECT \n    ic.ingredient_category,\n    SUM(sd.quantity) AS total_quantity,\n    (SUM(sd.quantity) * 100.0 / SUM(sd.quantity) OVER()) AS percentage\nFROM Sales_Details sd\nJOIN Ingredient_Categories ic ON sd.ingredient_id = ic.ingredient_id\nGROUP BY ic.ingredient_category;\n\nWait, but that would work? Because the SUM(sd.quantity) OVER() is the total across all rows. Then each group's sum divided by that total. Yes. But need to make sure that the denominator is not zero, but given the sample data, there are entries.\n\nAlternatively, using a subquery for total:\n\nSELECT \n    ic.ingredient_category,\n    SUM(sd.quantity) AS total_quantity,\n    (SUM(sd.quantity) * 100.0 / (SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM Sales_Details)) AS percentage\nFROM Sales_Details sd\nJOIN Ingredient_Categories ic ON sd.ingredient_id = ic.ingredient_id\nGROUP BY ic.ingredient_category;\n\nBut which approach is better? Both should work. The window function might be more efficient, but in terms of SQL standard, both are acceptable.\n\nBut let me check the sample data. The Sales_Details has four entries:\n\nsale_id 1, ingredient 1 (Legumes) quantity 2\n\nsale_id 1, ingredient 2 (Poultry) quantity 8\n\nsale_id 2, ingredient 1 (Legumes) quantity 3\n\nsale_id 2, ingredient 2 (Poultry) quantity 7\n\nSo total quantity is 2+8+3+7 = 20.\n\nFor Legumes: 2+3=5. Percentage is 5/20 *100 = 25%\n\nPoultry: 8+7=15. 15/20*100=75%\n\nSo the query should return two rows with those percentages.\n\nTesting the first approach with window function:\n\nThe SUM(sd.quantity) OVER() would be 20. Then each group's sum divided by 20.\n\nYes. So the SQL should work.\n\nBut need to make sure that the SUM is done correctly. Also, using 100.0 to avoid integer division.\n\nSo the SQL would be:\n\nSELECT \n    ic.ingredient_category,\n    SUM(sd.quantity) * 100.0 / SUM(sd.quantity) OVER() AS percentage\nFROM Sales_Details sd\nJOIN Ingredient_Categories ic ON sd.ingredient_id = ic.ingredient_id\nGROUP BY ic.ingredient_category;\n\nBut wait, the SUM(sd.quantity) in the numerator is per group, and the denominator is the total. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using a CTE for the total. But the window function approach is concise.\n\nBut maybe the user wants to see the total quantity per category as well. But the question says percentage, so maybe just the percentage is needed. However, the question says \"determine the percentage of sales from each ingredient category\", so perhaps the percentage is sufficient.\n\nBut the problem says to return the percentage. So the SQL should return the percentage.\n\nBut in the sample data, the answer would be Legumes 25%, Poultry 75%.\n\nSo the SQL should generate that.\n\nNow, checking for possible errors. Are there any ingredient categories with no sales? Probably not, since the sample data has both categories. But if there were, they would not appear in the result. But the question says \"from each ingredient category\", so maybe only those with sales.

{"example_id": 3329, "sql_complexity": "set operations", "prompt": "Which causes received funding from donors in both the United States and Canada?", "context": "CREATE TABLE donor_location (donor_id INT, country VARCHAR(50), cause VARCHAR(50), donation DECIMAL(10,2)); INSERT INTO donor_location (donor_id, country, cause, donation) VALUES (1, 'United States', 'Global Health', 1000.00), (2, 'Canada', 'Education', 2000.00), (3, 'United States', 'Environment', 1500.00), (4, 'Canada', 'Animal Welfare', 2500.00);", "reference_sql": "SELECT cause FROM donor_location WHERE country = 'United States' INTERSECT SELECT cause FROM donor_location WHERE country = 'Canada';", "generated_sql": "SELECT cause\nFROM donor_location\nWHERE country = 'United States'\nINTERSECT\nSELECT cause\nFROM donor_location\nWHERE country = 'Canada';", "raw_model_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know which causes received funding from both the United States and Canada. Hmm. So I need to find causes that have donations from both countries.\n\nFirst, I should look at the donor_location table. The columns are donor_id, country, cause, and donation. The question is about causes that have entries in both countries. \n\nMaybe I can start by grouping the data by cause and country, then check which causes have entries in both 'United States' and 'Canada'. But how to do that in SQL?\n\nI remember that using HAVING with COUNT and GROUP BY might help. If I group by cause, and then check if the count of distinct countries is 2 (since both US and Canada are two different countries). Wait, but maybe there's a case where a cause has more than two countries, but we need exactly both US and Canada. So maybe that approach isn't perfect.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a subquery to find causes that have at least one entry in the US and at least one in Canada. For example, using EXISTS or IN clauses. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: For each cause, check if there are entries in both countries. So, select causes where the cause exists in the table with country = 'United States' and also exists with country = 'Canada'.\n\nHow to write that? Maybe using a GROUP BY and HAVING clause with a condition that both countries are present. Wait, perhaps using HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT country) = 2. But that would work only if the cause has exactly two countries, but maybe the same cause could have more than two countries. However, the question is specifically about both US and Canada. So if a cause has donations from US, Canada, and another country, it would still count because it has both US and Canada. But the COUNT(DISTINCT country) would be 3, which would not equal 2. So that approach would miss those cases. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, no. The question is asking for causes that have funding from both countries. So even if a cause has donations from more than two countries, as long as it includes both US and Canada, it should be included. So the COUNT(DISTINCT country) approach would not work because it would require exactly two countries. So that's not the right way.\n\nAlternative idea: Use a subquery to find all causes that have at least one entry in the US and at least one in Canada. So, for each cause, check if there's a row where country is 'United States' and another row where country is 'Canada'.\n\nHow to do that? Maybe using HAVING with SUM(CASE WHEN country = 'United States' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0 AND SUM(CASE WHEN country = 'Canada' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0. That way, for each cause, we check if there are entries in both countries.\n\nYes, that could work. So the SQL would be:\n\nSELECT cause\nFROM donor_location\nGROUP BY cause\nHAVING SUM(CASE WHEN country = 'United States' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0\nAND SUM(CASE WHEN country = 'Canada' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0;\n\nAlternatively, using COUNT with conditions. But the SUM approach is straightforward.\n\nLet me test this with the sample data. The sample data has:\n\nDonor 1: US, Global Health, 1000\nDonor 2: Canada, Education, 2000\nDonor 3: US, Environment, 1500\nDonor 4: Canada, Animal Welfare, 2500\n\nSo for each cause:\n\nGlobal Health: only US. So no.\nEducation: only Canada. No.\nEnvironment: only US. No.\nAnimal Welfare: only Canada. No.\n\nWait, but according to the sample data, there are no causes that have both US and Canada. So the query would return nothing. But maybe the sample data is just an example and the actual data might have such cases. But according to the given data, the answer would be no causes. But the user's question is about the sample data? Or is the sample data just for the schema?\n\nWait, the user provided the schema and the sample data. The question is based on that data. So according to the sample data, there are no causes that have both US and Canada. So the answer would be an empty result set.\n\nBut the user's question is to write the SQL that would answer that. So the SQL I wrote would return the correct result for the sample data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a different approach with INTERSECT. For example, find all causes from US and then find those from Canada and intersect them. But how?\n\nAnother approach: \n\nSELECT DISTINCT cause\nFROM donor_location\nWHERE country = 'United States'\nAND cause IN (SELECT cause FROM donor_location WHERE country = 'Canada');\n\nBut that would work. Let's see. For each cause in the US, check if it exists in Canada. So in the sample data, there are no such causes. So the result is empty.\n\nBut in a case where a cause exists in both, it would return it. For example, if there was a cause 'Health' with entries from both countries, this would pick it up.\n\nSo which approach is better? The HAVING approach or the subquery with IN?\n\nBoth should work. Let me think about possible edge cases. For example, if a cause has multiple entries in the US and Canada. The HAVING approach would work, and the subquery approach would also work.\n\nBut the HAVING approach groups by cause and checks if both countries have entries. The subquery approach checks if the cause exists in both countries.\n\nIn terms of performance, it might depend on the database, but both are valid.\n\nSo the SQL query would be either of those. Let me pick one.\n\nThe user's sample data has no such causes, but the SQL should be correct.\n\nSo the answer would be:\n\nSELECT cause\nFROM donor_location\nGROUP BY cause\nHAVING SUM(CASE WHEN country = 'United States' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0\nAND SUM(CASE WHEN country = 'Canada' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0;\n\nAlternatively, using COUNT:\n\nHAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN country = 'United States' THEN 1 END) > 0\nAND COUNT(CASE WHEN country = 'Canada' THEN 1 END) > 0;\n\nBut SUM and COUNT would work similarly here.\n\nAlternatively, using HAVING MAX(country) = 'Canada' AND MIN(country) = 'United States'? No, that's not reliable because the order of countries isn't guaranteed.\n\nSo the first approach is better.\n\nAnother way is using INTERSECT:\n\nSELECT cause FROM donor_location WHERE country = 'United States'\nINTERSECT\nSELECT cause FROM donor_location WHERE country = 'Canada';\n\nBut that would return the causes that are present in both. That's another valid approach.\n\nSo which is better? The INTERSECT approach might be more readable. Let me think. For example, the INTERSECT method would return the causes that are in both lists. So that's straightforward.\n\nIn the sample data, the first query (using INTERSECT) would return nothing, which is correct.\n\nSo the SQL could be written as:\n\nSELECT cause\nFROM donor_location\nWHERE country = 'United States'\nINTERSECT\nSELECT cause\nFROM donor_location\nWHERE country = 'Canada';\n\nThat's a concise and correct approach. It's also ANSI SQL.\n\nSo which method is better? Both are correct. The INTERSECT approach might be more efficient, but it depends on the database. However, for the purpose of this question, either is acceptable.\n\nThe user's question is to write a single SQL statement. Both approaches are valid. Let me check which one is more appropriate.\n\nThe INTERSECT approach is concise and directly expresses the intent: find causes that are present in both sets. So that's probably better.\n\nSo the final SQL would be:\n\nSELECT cause\nFROM donor_location\nWHERE country = 'United States'\nINTERSECT\nSELECT cause\nFROM donor_location\nWHERE country = 'Canada';\n\nYes, that's correct. Let me test with the sample data. Since there are no overlapping causes, the result is empty. If there was a cause like 'Environment' in both countries, it would show up.\n\nTherefore, this SQL should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n```sql\nSELECT cause\nFROM donor_location\nWHERE country = 'United States'\nINTERSECT\nSELECT cause\nFROM donor_location\nWHERE country = 'Canada';\n```", "latency_sec": 41.293493032455444, "total_duration_sec": 41.195616069, "load_duration_sec": 0.016404463, "tokens_prompt": 213, "prompt_eval_sec": 0.038709306, "tokens_completion": 1802, "completion_eval_sec": 41.138351039, "tokens_total": 2015, "tokens_per_sec": 48.79703439997848, "match_exact": true, "match_ast": true, "llm_equivalent": true, "llm_explanation": "Both queries use the same structure: selecting 'cause' from donor_location where country is 'United States' and intersecting it with the same for Canada.

The user wants to know which company has manufactured the most satellites. So, I need to find out the manufacturer with the highest count of satellites.\n\nFirst, I should look at the tables involved. There's the manufacturers table and the satellites table. The satellites table has a manufacturer_id column that links to the manufacturers' id. So, I need to join these two tables on manufacturer_id.\n\nWait, but maybe I don't need to join them. The question is about counting the number of satellites per manufacturer. So, perhaps I can just count the number of entries in the satellites table grouped by manufacturer_id. But then, how do I get the manufacturer's name? Oh right, because the manufacturers table has the name. So I need to join them to get the name.\n\nSo the steps are: join manufacturers and satellites on manufacturer_id, then group by manufacturer_id (or name?), count the number of satellites per group, and then order by that count in descending order. Then pick the top one.\n\nBut how to write that in SQL. Let me think. The SQL statement would be:\n\nSELECT m.name, COUNT(*) as num_satellites\nFROM manufacturers m\nJOIN satellites s ON m.id = s.manufacturer_id\nGROUP BY m.id\nORDER BY num_satellites DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n\nWait, but grouping by m.id or m.name? Since manufacturers.id is the primary key, grouping by id is sufficient. But if there are multiple manufacturers with the same name (unlikely, but possible), but in the given data, names are unique. So grouping by id is safe.\n\nAlternatively, grouping by m.name would also work here, but since id is the primary key, it's better to group by id. But in the SELECT clause, we have m.name. In SQL, when using GROUP BY, the SELECT clause can include columns that are functionally dependent on the GROUP BY columns. So since each id corresponds to exactly one name, it's allowed.\n\nSo the query should work. Let me check the sample data.\n\nManufacturers: SpaceX (1), Blue Origin (2), ISRO (3), CAST (4).\n\nSatellites:\n\nmanufacturer_id 1 (SpaceX) has 4 entries (id 1,2,7,8). Wait, looking at the INSERT statements:\n\nSatellites:\n\n(1,1,'StarDragon','2012-05-25'), (2,1,'Falcon','2015-12-21'), (3,2,'New Glenn','2022-01-11'), (4,3,'ChinaSat 1E','2000-12-05'), (5,3,'ChinaSat 2A','2003-08-13'), (6,4,'Shijian 9','2017-11-19'), (7,1,'StarLink','2020-05-24'), (8,1,'StarLink','2020-06-13');\n\nSo manufacturer_id 1 has 4 satellites (ids 1,2,7,8). Manufacturer 3 (ISRO) has 2 satellites (4,5). Manufacturer 2 (Blue Origin) has 1 (id3), manufacturer 4 (CAST) has 1 (id6). So the count would be SpaceX with 4, ISRO 2, etc. So the query should return SpaceX as the manufacturer with the most satellites.\n\nSo the SQL query should correctly return that. Also, what if there's a tie? The question says \"the most\", so if two companies have the same highest count, the query would return the first one (depending on the order). But in the sample data, there's no tie.\n\nSo the SQL query seems correct. Now, the user wants the answer as a single SQL statement. So the answer is the query I wrote above.\n</think>\n\n```sql\nSELECT m.name, COUNT(*) AS num_satellites\nFROM manufacturers m\nJOIN satellites s ON m.id = s.manufacturer_id\nGROUP BY m.id\nORDER BY num_satellites DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```", "latency_sec": 19.913641929626465, "total_duration_sec": 19.806281081, "load_duration_sec": 0.018755143, "tokens_prompt": 348, "prompt_eval_sec": 0.067430603, "tokens_completion": 871, "completion_eval_sec": 19.716951542, "tokens_total": 1219, "tokens_per_sec": 61.21431751700005, "match_exact": false, "match_ast": false, "llm_equivalent": false, "llm_explanation": "The queries differ in two key aspects.

The user wants the total production quantity of silver for mining sites in Mexico between May 1st and September 30th, 2017, and the sites must have less than 40 employees.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table structure. The table is silver_mine_2 with columns site_id, country, num_employees, extraction_date, and quantity. The data inserted has three entries from Mexico with different dates and quantities.\n\nThe question specifies Mexico, so the WHERE clause should filter country = 'Mexico'. Then the date range: extraction_date between '2017-05-01' and '2017-09-30'. Also, num_employees must be less than 40. \n\nWait, the dates in the data are '2017-05-02', '2017-08-31', and '2017-07-04'. All of these fall within the specified range. But the user's query includes the entire period from May 1 to September 30.

The three entries are all from Mexico. Their num_employees are 35, 30, 37. All are less than 40. The dates are all within the range.

But the problem is that the user hasn't specified the exact data. However, the task is to generate an SQL statement that inserts new records. Since the user hasn't provided specific values, perhaps the answer should be a generic insert statement that includes placeholders for the values.\n\nBut the original example inserts have specific values. However, the user's question is to insert new records, so maybe the answer should be an insert into tickets, events, and salesperson? But the salesperson information might already exist. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to insert into events and tickets. But the problem says \"including event and salesperson information.\" So perhaps the salesperson information is also being inserted. But the original schema has a salesperson already inserted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to insert a new event into events, and then insert a new ticket into tickets, using an existing salesperson. But without specific values, the SQL would need to have placeholders. However, the initial inserts in the schema have specific values. Maybe the user expects to insert a new event with event_id 3, name 'Another Event', date '2023-05-01', and then insert a ticket with ticket_id 3, salesperson_id 1, event_id 3, price 100.00, quantity 5.

Since the user hasn't provided specific values, perhaps the answer should be an insert into events and tickets. However, the problem says \"including event and salesperson information.\" So maybe the salesperson is also being inserted. But the original salesperson table already has a record. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to insert into tickets, using existing event and salesperson data. For example, inserting a new ticket for event_id 2 (which already exists) and salesperson_id 1 (which exists). But the question says \"a new event,\" so the event must be inserted into the events table. \n\nSo the correct approach is to insert into events first, then into tickets. But the user's question is to insert new records of ticket sales for a new event. So the SQL would be two insert statements: one for events and one for tickets. However, the user's instruction says to translate the question into a single executable SQL statement. But inserting into two tables would require two statements. However, maybe the user expects a single insert into tickets, assuming that the event already exists. But the question says \"a new event,\" so the event must be inserted. \n\nBut the problem is that the user hasn't provided specific values. However, the initial inserts in the schema have some data. Maybe the user expects to insert a new event with event_id 3, and then insert a ticket for that event. But without knowing the exact values, the SQL would need to have placeholders. However, the original example inserts have specific values. Maybe the user expects to use the same pattern. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to insert into the tickets table, using the existing event and salesperson. But the question says \"a new event,\" so the event must be inserted. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, the original context includes an insert into events with event_id 2. So maybe the user wants to insert a new event with event_id 3, and then insert a ticket for that event. But the SQL would need to have specific values. However, since the user hasn't provided them, perhaps the answer is to insert into events and tickets with placeholders. But the user's example inserts have specific values. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to insert into tickets, using the existing event (event_id 2) and salesperson (salesperson_id 1). But the question says \"a new event,\" which implies that the event is new. \n\nIn that case, the correct approach is to insert into events first, then into tickets. But the user's instruction says to generate a single SQL statement. However, inserting into two tables would require two statements. Unless using a compound statement, but that's not standard SQL. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says \"a single, executable SQL statement.\" So perhaps the answer is to insert into both tables in a single statement. But standard SQL doesn't allow inserting into multiple tables in a single INSERT statement. Unless using a stored procedure or something else, but that's not standard. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be two separate insert statements. However, the user's instruction says to generate a single SQL statement. This is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is only inserting into the tickets table, assuming that the event already exists. But the question says \"a new event,\" so that's not correct. \n\nHmm. Maybe the user made a mistake in the question, but given the constraints, the best approach is to insert into the events table and the tickets table. However, since the user requires a single SQL statement, perhaps the answer is to insert into the tickets table, using the existing event and salesperson. But the question says \"a new event,\" which would require inserting into events. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to insert into the events table and the tickets table in a single statement. But that's not possible in standard SQL. \n\nWait, perhaps the user is referring to inserting into the tickets table, and the event information is already present. But the question says \"a new event,\" so the event must be inserted. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. However, looking back at the original problem, the user provided an example where the events table has an event with event_id 2. So maybe the user wants to insert a new event with event_id 3, and then insert a ticket for that event. But the SQL would need to have specific values. \n\nAssuming that the user wants to insert a new event and a new ticket, the SQL would be two insert statements. However, the user's instruction says to generate a single SQL statement. Therefore, perhaps the answer is to insert into the tickets table, assuming that the event already exists. But that contradicts the question's mention of a new event. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to inserting into the tickets table, and the event and salesperson information is already in the database. But the question says \"including event and salesperson information,\" which might mean that the event and salesperson are being inserted as part of the ticket insertion. But that's not possible. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the user's instruction to generate a single SQL statement, perhaps the answer is to insert into the tickets table, using the existing event and salesperson. Even though the question mentions a new event, maybe that's a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, the user might have intended to insert into the events table and the tickets table, but the answer must be two separate statements. However, the user's instruction says to generate a single SQL statement. \n\nThis is a problem. Given the constraints, I think the best approach is to insert into the events table and the tickets table, even though it requires two statements. However, the user's instruction says to generate a single SQL statement. Therefore, perhaps the answer is to insert into the tickets table, assuming that the event already exists. \n\nBut the question says \"a new event,\" which implies that the event is being inserted. Therefore, the answer must include inserting into both tables. However, since the user requires a single SQL statement, this is not possible. \n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is to insert into the events table and the tickets table, even though it requires two statements. However, the user's instruction says to generate a single SQL statement, which is conflicting. Therefore, the answer must be two insert statements, but the user might have made a mistake in the instruction. \n\nBut given the user's instruction, I'll proceed with the assumption that the user wants to insert into the tickets table, using the existing event and salesperson. Even though the question mentions a new event, perhaps that's a mistake. \n\nTherefore, the SQL statement would be:\n\nINSERT INTO tickets (event_id, salesperson_id, ...) VALUES (2, 1, ...);\n\nBut this is speculative. However, given the ambiguity, this is the best possible answer.\n</think>\n\nTo address the question accurately, we must interpret the intent behind the instruction: *\"You are to translate the following question into a single, executable SQL statement.\"* The question is:\n\n> **\"Insert new records into the database representing the sale of tickets for a new event.\"**\n\nThis implies that **both** the **event** and the **ticket sales** are to be inserted into the database. However, the challenge is that **standard SQL does not allow inserting into multiple tables in a single `INSERT` statement**. Therefore, we must use **two separate `INSERT` statements** to fulfill the requirement of inserting a **new event** and **new ticket records** for that event.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Assumptions:**\n\n- The database has a table named `events` with at least the following columns:\n  - `event_id` (primary key, integer)\n  - `event_name` (string)\n  - `date` (date)\n\n- The database has a table named `tickets` with at least the following columns:\n  - `ticket_id` (primary key, integer)\n  - `event_id` (foreign key to `events`)\n  - `price` (decimal)\n  - `quantity` (integer)\n\n- We are inserting **one new event** and **one new ticket** for that event.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **SQL Statements:**\n\n```sql\n-- Insert the new event\nINSERT INTO events (event_id, event_name, date)\nVALUES (101, 'Summer Concert', '2025-08-15');\n\n-- Insert a new ticket for the event\nINSERT INTO tickets (ticket_id, event_id, price, quantity)\nVALUES (201, 101, 50.00, 100);\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Explanation:**\n\n- The first `INSERT` adds a new event with an `event_id` of 101, a name, and a date.\n- The second `INSERT` adds a new ticket record for that event, referencing the `event_id` just inserted.\n- These are **two separate SQL statements**, but they are both **valid and executable** in a single SQL script.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Note:**\n\nIf the system requires a **single SQL statement** (e.g., for a stored procedure or a script that must be one line), you could use a **compound statement** with `;` as a separator, but this is not a single `INSERT` statement. However, it is still a **single executable SQL script**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Answer (as a single executable SQL script):**\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO events (event_id, event_name, date) VALUES (101, 'Summer Concert', '2025-08-15');\nINSERT INTO tickets (ticket_id, event_id, price, quantity) VALUES (201, 101, 50.00, 100);\n```\n\nThis script inserts a new event and a new ticket for that event, fulfilling the requirement of the question.", "latency_sec": 66.64312601089478, "total_duration_sec": 66.392898821, "load_duration_sec": 0.019840818, "tokens_prompt": 201, "prompt_eval_sec": 0.036877074, "tokens_completion": 2888, "completion_eval_sec": 66.334048772, "tokens_total": 3089, "tokens_per_sec": 46.35136712367022, "match_exact": false, "match_ast": false, "llm_equivalent": false, "llm_explanation": "The queries are not semantically equivalent.

The user wants the total number of students and staff who have accommodations, but they need to exclude those with the \"accessibility_parking\" type. \n\nFirst, I need to check the schema. There are two tables: staff and students. Both have an 'accommodation' column. The question is about counting entries where accommodation is not 'accessibility_parking'.\n\nSo, I should write a query that selects from both tables, filters out the 'accessibility_parking' entries, and then counts the total rows. Since both tables have the same structure, maybe I can use a UNION ALL to combine the results. \n\nWait, but the tables are different. Staff and students are separate. So, I need to query each table individually, apply the filter, and then sum the counts. Alternatively, I can use a UNION ALL to combine the two tables into a single result set, then count the rows. But since the tables are in the same schema, maybe that's possible.\n\nWait, but the tables have different names. Let me think. If I do a SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT * FROM staff WHERE accommodation != 'accessibility_parking' UNION ALL SELECT * FROM students WHERE accommodation != 'accessibility_parking') AS combined, that would work. But the problem is that the columns need to be compatible. Both tables have id, name, accommodation. So the columns match, so the union is okay.\n\nBut the user just wants the count. So the subquery would combine all the rows from both tables (excluding accessibility_parking), and then count them. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could count each table separately and add them. Like (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM staff WHERE accommodation != 'accessibility_parking') + (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students WHERE accommodation != 'accessibility_parking'). But in SQL, adding two scalar values can be done with a UNION ALL and then summing, or using a CTE.\n\nBut the user wants a single SQL statement. So perhaps the first approach with the union all is better. Let me check.\n\nAnother approach: using a common table expression (CTE) to get the counts from each table and then adding them. But the user wants a single executable SQL statement. Let me think about the simplest way.\n\nThe question is to get the total number of students and staff with accommodations (so, the accommodation column is not null?), but the question says \"with accommodations\" which might mean that the accommodation is not null. Wait, but the question says \"excluding the 'accessibility_parking' type\". So, the accommodation is present (i.e., not null) and not equal to 'accessibility_parking'.\n\nWait, the original question says \"with accommodations in the 'disability_services' schema, excluding the 'accessibility_parking' type\". So, the accommodation column's value is not 'accessibility_parking', but it's possible that some entries have null in accommodation. But the wording is \"with accommodations\", which might imply that the accommodation is present (i.e., not null). However, the problem is that the question is ambiguous here. But since the schema defines the accommodation column as VARCHAR(50), but it's possible that some entries have null. However, the question says \"with accommodations\", which might mean that the accommodation is not null. But the original problem may not require that. Let me recheck the question.\n\nThe question says: \"total number of students and staff with accommodations in the 'disability_services' schema, excluding the 'accessibility_parking' type\". So, the 'with accommodations' part might mean that the accommodation is not null. But the problem is that the question is not explicit. However, the original problem may not require that. For example, if the accommodation is not null, then the count would be those entries where accommodation is not null and not 'accessibility_parking'. But if the question is just about the accommodation column's value not being 'accessibility_parking', regardless of whether it's null or not, then the condition would be accommodation != 'accessibility_parking'.\n\nBut the wording is \"with accommodations\", which might imply that the accommodation is present. However, since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the safest way is to assume that the user wants to count all entries where the accommodation is not 'accessibility_parking', regardless of whether it's null or not. But that's a bit ambiguous. However, given that the problem is about counting people with accommodations, it's more likely that the accommodation is not null. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the correct approach is to count all rows where the accommodation is not 'accessibility_parking', regardless of nulls. However, the original question may not have that in mind. But since the problem is to translate the question into SQL, perhaps the user intended that the accommodation is not null and not 'accessibility_parking'.\n\nBut the problem is that the original question is not clear. However, given that the schema defines the accommodation column as VARCHAR(50), but in practice, it's possible that some entries have null. However, the problem may not require handling that. Since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the correct approach is to count all rows where the accommodation is not 'accessibility_parking', regardless of nulls. But the wording \"with accommodations\" might imply that the accommodation is present (i.e., not null). However, without explicit information, perhaps the safest way is to proceed with the condition that accommodation is not 'accessibility_parking', and not worry about nulls. Because the user may not have considered that, and the problem is to translate the question as written.\n\nSo, proceeding with that, the SQL would be:\n\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM (\n    SELECT * FROM staff WHERE accommodation != 'accessibility_parking'\n    UNION ALL\n    SELECT * FROM students WHERE accommodation != 'accessibility_parking'\n) AS combined;\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the tables have different columns? No, both tables have id, name, accommodation. So the columns match. So the union all is okay.\n\nAlternatively, using a CTE:\n\nWITH staff_count AS (\n    SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM staff WHERE accommodation != 'accessibility_parking'\n),\nstudent_count AS (\n    SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM students WHERE accommodation != 'accessibility_parking'\n)\nSELECT (staff_count.cnt + student_count.cnt) AS total FROM staff_count, student_count;\n\nBut that's a bit more complex. However, the first approach with the union all is more straightforward.\n\nBut the problem is that the user wants a single SQL statement. Both approaches are valid. However, the first approach with the union all and then count is a single query.\n\nAlternatively, using a CASE statement. But that's not necessary.\n\nAnother approach: using a subquery that adds the counts from both tables.\n\nSELECT \n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM staff WHERE accommodation != 'accessibility_parking') +\n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students WHERE accommodation != 'accessibility_parking') AS total;\n\nThis is a single query, and it's concise. That might be the best approach.\n\nYes, this seems better. Because it's a single query, and it's straightforward. So the SQL would be:\n\nSELECT \n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM staff WHERE accommodation != 'accessibility_parking') +\n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students WHERE accommodation != 'accessibility_parking') AS total;\n\nBut need to make sure that the schema is correctly referenced. Since the tables are in the 'disability_services' schema, the correct syntax would be to qualify the table names with the schema.\n\nSo the correct SQL would be:\n\nSELECT \n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM disability_services.staff WHERE accommodation != 'accessibility_parking') +\n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM disability_services.students WHERE accommodation != 'accessibility_parking') AS total;\n\nYes, that's correct. Because the tables are in the 'disability_services' schema, as per the CREATE SCHEMA statement.\n\nSo that's the final answer.\n</think>\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM disability_services.staff WHERE accommodation != 'accessibility_parking') +\n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM disability_services.students WHERE accommodation != 'accessibility_parking') AS total;\n```", "latency_sec": 38.91410803794861, "total_duration_sec": 38.713715582, "load_duration_sec": 0.025183774, "tokens_prompt": 150, "prompt_eval_sec": 0.04307211, "tokens_completion": 1699, "completion_eval_sec": 38.640435791, "tokens_total": 1849, "tokens_per_sec": 47.514901233169105, "match_exact": false, "match_ast": false, "llm_equivalent": false, "llm_explanation": "The Reference SQL returns two separate counts (staff and students) as individual rows via UNION, while the Generated SQL calculates a single total count by summing the two subquery results.

The user is asking for the maximum number of virtual tours taken by a single user in the UK. Hmm. So I need to find out which user has the highest count of tours, but only considering users who are in the UK.\n\nWait, but the virtual_tour_data table has user_id and hotel_id. The hotels table has hotel_id and country. So to find the country of a hotel, I need to join these two tables on hotel_id. Then, filter where the country is 'UK'. \n\nSo first, I need to join virtual_tour_data with hotels on hotel_id. Then, group by user_id and count the number of tours per user. But only for those hotels in the UK. Then, find the maximum value of that count.\n\nWait, but how do I know which user is in the UK? Wait, the user's country isn't directly stored. Wait, the question says \"a single user in the UK\". Wait, but the user's country isn't in the tables. Wait, maybe the question is about the hotels in the UK. Because the virtual tours are associated with hotels. So maybe the user is considered to be in the UK if they took a tour at a UK hotel? Or is there another way?\n\nWait, the question is ambiguous. But looking at the tables, there's no user's country. The only country info is in the hotels table. So perhaps the question is about users who have taken tours at UK hotels. So the user's country isn't tracked, but the tours they took are in the UK. So the question is, for each user, count how many tours they took at UK hotels, and find the maximum count.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the steps are:\n\n1. Join virtual_tour_data with hotels on hotel_id.\n2. Filter where country is 'UK'.\n3. Group by user_id and count the number of tours per user.\n4. Find the maximum count from those grouped results.\n\nSo the SQL would be:\n\nSELECT MAX(tour_count) AS max_tours\nFROM (\n    SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS tour_count\n    FROM virtual_tour_data vt\n    JOIN hotels h ON vt.hotel_id = h.hotel_id\n    WHERE h.country = 'UK'\n    GROUP BY user_id\n) AS user_tours;\n\nWait, but what if a user has taken tours in both UK and non-UK hotels? But the question is about tours taken in the UK. So only the UK tours are considered. So the count is only for UK hotels.\n\nYes. So that query would work. Let me check the sample data.\n\nLooking at the sample data:\n\nvirtual_tour_data has entries:\n\nuser_id 1, hotel_id 10 (which is in UK)\nuser_id 2, hotel_id 11 (UK)\nuser_id 3, hotel_id 12 (France)\nuser_id 4, hotel_id 10 (UK)\nuser_id 5, hotel_id 10 (UK)\n\nSo the UK hotels are 10 and 11. So the tours for user 1, 2, 4, 5 are in UK. User 3's tour is in France.\n\nSo the counts:\n\nuser 1: 1 tour\nuser 2: 1\nuser 4: 1\nuser 5: 1\n\nWait, but in the sample data, user 1 has one tour, user 2 has one, user 4 and 5 each have one. So the maximum is 1. But maybe in the actual data, there are users with more. But according to the sample data, the answer would be 1. But the question is to write the SQL, not compute the answer.\n\nBut the SQL query I wrote would correctly compute that.

The user wants to calculate the percentage of Shariah-compliant investments for each investor in the top 5 countries with the highest percentage. Hmm, first, I need to understand the schema. There are two tables: investors and investments. The investors table has investor_id, investor_name, and country. The investments table has investment_id, investor_id, investment_type, investment_value, and is_shariah_compliant.\n\nSo the goal is to find, for each investor, the percentage of their investments that are Shariah-compliant. But then, only consider the top 5 countries where this percentage is highest. Wait, the question says \"the top 5 countries with the highest percentage\". Wait, does that mean first calculate the percentage per investor, then group by country and take the top 5 countries based on that percentage? Or is it per country?\n\nWait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the question: \"Calculate the percentage of Shariah-compliant investments held by each investor in the top 5 countries with the highest percentage?\" So, the percentage is per investor, but only for those investors who are in the top 5 countries. Wait, no. Maybe it's the countries that have the highest percentage of Shariah-compliant investments. But the percentage is per investor, so perhaps the countries are determined by the investors' countries, and then for each country, we look at the investors in that country, compute their individual percentages, and then take the top 5 countries based on some aggregate metric?\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for each investor, compute their percentage of Shariah-compliant investments, but only include investors from the top 5 countries (based on some metric related to their percentage). But the wording is unclear. Alternatively, maybe the top 5 countries are determined by the average or total percentage of Shariah-compliant investments of their investors, and then for those countries, list each investor's percentage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is to find the top 5 countries (based on the percentage of Shariah-compliant investments by their investors) and then for each investor in those countries, calculate their own percentage.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The question says: \"the percentage of Shariah-compliant investments held by each investor in the top 5 countries with the highest percentage?\" So, the percentage is per investor, but the investor must be in one of the top 5 countries. The top 5 countries are determined by some metric. But what metric? The percentage of Shariah-compliant investments for the country's investors? Or something else?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the top 5 countries are determined by the highest percentage of their own investors' Shariah-compliant investments. For example, for each country, compute the average percentage of Shariah-compliant investments of its investors, then take the top 5 countries with the highest average, and then for each investor in those countries, show their individual percentage.\n\nBut how to compute that? Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, for each investor, calculate the percentage of their investments that are Shariah-compliant. That would be (sum of investment_value where is_shariah_compliant is true) divided by (total investment_value for the investor) multiplied by 100. But the question says \"percentage of Shariah-compliant investments held by each investor\", so that's per investor.\n\nBut then, the question says \"in the top 5 countries with the highest percentage\". So perhaps the countries are ranked based on the average percentage of Shariah-compliant investments of their investors, and the top 5 countries are selected based on that. Then, for each investor in those countries, show their individual percentage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the countries are ranked based on the total number of Shariah-compliant investments, but the wording says \"highest percentage\", which implies a percentage metric.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. For each investor, calculate their percentage of Shariah-compliant investments.\n\n2. For each country, calculate some aggregate metric (like average percentage of investors in that country) to determine the top 5 countries.\n\n3. Then, select the investors from those top 5 countries and show their individual percentages.\n\nBut how to compute the aggregate metric for the countries. Let's assume that the country's metric is the average percentage of Shariah-compliant investments of its investors. Then, the top 5 countries would be those with the highest average.\n\nBut how to compute that in SQL.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the country's metric is the percentage of all investments in the country that are Shariah-compliant. But that's different from the investor's perspective.\n\nBut the question says \"the percentage of Shariah-compliant investments held by each investor in the top 5 countries with the highest percentage\". So the percentage is per investor, but the countries are selected based on some metric related to their investors' percentages.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but perhaps the intended approach is:\n\n- For each country, compute the average percentage of Shariah-compliant investments for its investors.\n\n- Rank the countries by that average, take the top 5.\n\n- Then, for each investor in those countries, compute their own percentage.\n\nBut how to do that in SQL.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is to find the top 5 countries (based on the percentage of their own investments that are Shariah-compliant), and then for each investor in those countries, compute their percentage.\n\nBut that's a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the data. The investors table has country, and the investments table has investor_id. So each investment is linked to an investor, who is in a country.\n\nSo, for each country, we can calculate the total number of investments, or the total investment value, and the total Shariah-compliant investment value.\n\nBut the question is about the percentage of Shariah-compliant investments held by each investor. So per investor, not per country.\n\nBut the countries are selected based on some metric. The wording is confusing. Let me try to rephrase the question: \"Calculate the percentage of Shariah-compliant investments held by each investor in the top 5 countries with the highest percentage?\" So, the percentage is per investor, but the investor must be in one of the top 5 countries. The top 5 countries are determined by their own percentage of something.\n\nBut what's the percentage for the countries? Maybe the percentage of their investors' investments that are Shariah-compliant. For example, for each country, compute the average percentage of Shariah-compliant investments across all investors in that country. Then, select the top 5 countries with the highest average, and then for each investor in those countries, show their individual percentage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the country's percentage is the total Shariah-compliant investments divided by total investments in that country. But that's different from the investor's perspective.\n\nBut the question is about the investor's percentage, but the countries are selected based on their own metric.\n\nThis is a bit of a puzzle. Let's try to proceed with the first interpretation.\n\nFirst, compute for each investor their percentage of Shariah-compliant investments.\n\nThen, for each country, compute the average of these percentages across all investors in that country. Then, select the top 5 countries with the highest average. Then, for each investor in those countries, show their percentage.\n\nBut how to do that in SQL.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is to find the top 5 countries based on the percentage of their own investments that are Shariah-compliant, and then for each investor in those countries, compute their own percentage.\n\nBut that would be different.\n\nLet me think about the data. For example, in the sample data:\n\nInvestors:\n\n1: Al Thani, Qatar\n\n2: Saudi Investment Group, Saudi Arabia\n\n3: Temasek Holdings, Singapore\n\nInvestments:\n\nInvestment 1: investor 1, Real Estate, 15M, true\n\nInvestment 2: investor 2, Stocks, 20M, false\n\nSo for investor 1, percentage is 100% (only one investment, which is Shariah-compliant).\n\nFor investor 2, percentage is 0% (only one investment, not compliant).\n\nFor investor 3, no investments in the sample data.\n\nNow, the countries are Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore.\n\nIf we compute for each country the average percentage of their investors:\n\nQatar: investor 1 has 100% \u2192 average is 100%.\n\nSaudi Arabia: investor 2 has 0% \u2192 average is 0%.\n\nSingapore: investor 3 has no investments, so maybe 0% or not considered.\n\nSo the top 5 countries would be Qatar (100%), then others. But in this case, only one country.\n\nBut the question says \"top 5 countries\", which implies that there are more than 5 countries in the actual data.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the intended approach is to compute for each country the percentage of investments that are Shariah-compliant, and then select the top 5 countries based on that, and then for each investor in those countries, compute their own percentage.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nFor example, for each country, total investment value and total Shariah-compliant investment value.\n\nThen, the percentage for the country is (total compliant / total) * 100.\n\nThen, select the top 5 countries with highest percentage.\n\nThen, for each investor in those countries, compute their own percentage.\n\nBut that's a different approach.\n\nBut the question says \"the percentage of Shariah-compliant investments held by each investor in the top 5 countries with the highest percentage\".\n\nSo the percentage is per investor, but the countries are selected based on their own percentage.\n\nBut which percentage? The country's percentage could be the percentage of their own investments that are compliant.\n\nBut that's not the same as the investor's percentage.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the intended approach is to compute for each country the percentage of their own investments that are compliant, select the top 5 countries, and then for each investor in those countries, compute their own percentage.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nLet me try to write the SQL for that.\n\nFirst, compute for each country the percentage of compliant investments:\n\nWITH CountryStats AS (\n    SELECT \n        i.country,\n        SUM(CASE WHEN inv.is_compliant = 1 THEN inv.value ELSE 0 END) AS total_compliant,\n        SUM(inv.value) AS total_investments\n    FROM investors i\n    JOIN investments inv ON i.id = inv.investor_id\n    GROUP BY i.country\n),\nTopCountries AS (\n    SELECT \n        country,\n        (total_compliant / total_investments) * 100 AS compliance_percentage\n    FROM CountryStats\n    ORDER BY compliance_percentage DESC\n    LIMIT 5\n)\n\nThen, for each investor in those countries, compute their own percentage:\n\nSELECT \n    i.id,\n    i.name,\n    i.country,\n    (SUM(CASE WHEN inv.is_compliant = 1 THEN inv.value ELSE 0 END) / SUM(inv.value)) * 100 AS investor_compliance_percentage\nFROM investors i\nJOIN investments inv ON i.id = inv.investor_id\nWHERE i.country IN (SELECT country FROM TopCountries)\nGROUP BY i.id, i.name, i.country;\n\nBut this is assuming that the country's percentage is based on the total investments in the country.\n\nBut the question is about the investor's percentage, but the countries are selected based on their own metric.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, this might be the intended approach.\n\nAlternatively, if the country's metric is the average of the investors' percentages, then:\n\nFirst, compute for each investor their percentage:\n\nWITH InvestorStats AS (\n    SELECT \n        i.id,\n        i.name,\n        i.country,\n        (SUM(CASE WHEN inv.is_compliant = 1 THEN inv.value ELSE 0 END) / SUM(inv.value)) * 100 AS investor_compliance_percentage\n    FROM investors i\n    JOIN investments inv ON i.id = inv.investor_id\n    GROUP BY i.id, i.name, i.country\n),\nCountryAverage AS (\n    SELECT \n        country,\n        AVG(investor_compliance_percentage) AS avg_percentage\n    FROM InvestorStats\n    GROUP BY country\n),\nTopCountries AS (\n    SELECT \n        country\n    FROM CountryAverage\n    ORDER BY avg_percentage DESC\n    LIMIT 5\n)\n\nThen, select the investors in those countries:\n\nSELECT \n    id,\n    name,\n    country,\n    investor_compliance_percentage\nFROM InvestorStats\nWHERE country IN (SELECT country FROM TopCountries);\n\nBut this is another approach.\n\nBut the question is not clear on which metric to use for the countries.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but the mention of \"percentage of Shariah-compliant investments held by each investor\", it's possible that the country's metric is the average of the investors' percentages.\n\nBut without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nBut given that the user provided sample data, perhaps the intended answer is to compute for each investor their percentage, and then select the top 5 countries based on the average of those percentages, and then show the investors in those countries.\n\nBut in the sample data, the countries are Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore.\n\nIn the first approach, the country's average is 100% for Qatar, 0% for Saudi Arabia, and Singapore has no investors with investments (assuming investor 3 has no investments), so maybe 0% or not considered.\n\nSo the top 5 countries would be Qatar.\n\nThen, the investors in Qatar would be the ones with the highest percentage.\n\nBut in the sample data, if investor 1 is in Qatar and has some investments, their percentage would be calculated.\n\nBut without knowing the actual data, it's hard to say.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the user expects the second approach, where the country's metric is the average of the investors' percentages.\n\nBut since the user hasn't provided specific data, the answer should be general.\n\nBut the user might have expected a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, the question might be asking to find the top 5 countries with the highest percentage of compliant investments, and then for each investor in those countries, show their compliance percentage.\n\nBut again, without more context, it's hard to know.\n\nBut given that the user mentioned \"percentage of Shariah-compliant investments held by each investor\", it's likely that the focus is on the investor's percentage, and the countries are selected based on some metric.\n\nBut since the question is not clear, the answer should probably explain both approaches.\n\nBut given that the user might have intended the first approach, where the country's metric is the percentage of compliant investments, and then the investors in those countries are selected.\n\nBut to proceed, I'll outline both approaches and explain the ambiguity.\n</think>\n\nTo address the query, we need to interpret the phrase **\"percentage of Shariah-compliant investments held by each investor in the top 5 countries with the highest percentage\"**. This can be interpreted in two distinct ways, depending on what metric is used to define the \"top 5 countries.\" Below are the two possible interpretations, along with the corresponding SQL queries.\n\n---\n\n### **Interpretation 1: Top Countries Based on Average Investor Compliance Percentage**\n\nThis approach assumes that the \"top 5 countries\" are determined by the **average compliance percentage of all investors** in that country. Then, we select the investors in those countries and compute their individual compliance percentages.\n\n#### **SQL Query:**\n\n```sql\nWITH InvestorStats AS (\n    SELECT \n        i.id,\n        i.name,\n        i.country,\n        (SUM(CASE WHEN inv.is_compliant = 1 THEN inv.value ELSE 0 END) / SUM(inv.value)) * 100 AS investor_compliance_percentage\n    FROM investors i\n    JOIN investments inv ON i.id = inv.investor_id\n    GROUP BY i.id, i.name, i.country\n),\nCountryAverage AS (\n    SELECT \n        country,\n        AVG(investor_compliance_percentage) AS avg_percentage\n    FROM InvestorStats\n    GROUP BY country\n),\nTopCountries AS (\n    SELECT \n        country\n    FROM CountryAverage\n    ORDER BY avg_percentage DESC\n    LIMIT 5\n)\nSELECT \n    id,\n    name,\n    country,\n    investor_compliance_percentage\nFROM InvestorStats\nWHERE country IN (SELECT country FROM TopCountries);\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Interpretation 2: Top Countries Based on Overall Investment Compliance Percentage**\n\nThis approach assumes that the \"top 5 countries\" are determined by the **overall percentage of compliant investments** in the country (i.e., the proportion of total investment value that is Shariah-compliant). Then, we select the investors in those countries and compute their individual compliance percentages.\n\n#### **SQL Query:**\n\n```sql\nWITH CountryStats AS (\n    SELECT \n        i.country,\n        SUM(CASE WHEN inv.is_compliant = 1 THEN inv.value ELSE 0 END) AS total_compliant,\n        SUM(inv.value) AS total_investments\n    FROM investors i\n    JOIN investments inv ON i.id = inv.investor_id\n    GROUP BY i.country\n),\nTopCountries AS (\n    SELECT \n        country,\n        (total_compliant / total_investments) * 100 AS compliance_percentage\n    FROM CountryStats\n    ORDER BY compliance_percentage DESC\n    LIMIT 5\n),\nInvestorStats AS (\n    SELECT \n        i.id,\n        i.name,\n        i.country,\n        (SUM(CASE WHEN inv.is_compliant = 1 THEN inv.value ELSE 0 END) / SUM(inv.value)) * 100 AS investor_compliance_percentage\n    FROM investors i\n    JOIN investments inv ON i.id = inv.investor_id\n    GROUP BY i.id, i.name, i.country\n)\nSELECT \n    id,\n    name,\n    country,\n    investor_compliance_percentage\nFROM InvestorStats\nWHERE country IN (SELECT country FROM TopCountries);\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Key Differences Between the Two Approaches**\n\n| **Aspect**                        | **Interpretation 1**                          | **Interpretation 2**                          |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **Metric for Top Countries**     | Average investor compliance percentage        | Overall investment compliance percentage      |\n| **Focus**                        | Country-level average of investor compliance  | Country-level compliance of total investments |\n| **Use Case**                     | When the goal is to identify countries with the most compliant investors | When the goal is to identify countries with the most compliant investments overall |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe correct interpretation depends on the **specific intent** of the query. If the goal is to find **countries with the most compliant investors**, use **Interpretation 1**. If the goal is to find **countries with the most compliant investments**, use **Interpretation 2**.\n\nIf the original context or data provides further clarification (e.g., whether the focus is on **investors** or **investments**), the query can be refined accordingly.", "latency_sec": 91.82713603973389, "total_duration_sec": 91.281039114, "load_duration_sec": 0.013694596, "tokens_prompt": 263, "prompt_eval_sec": 0.049350053, "tokens_completion": 3952, "completion_eval_sec": 91.215265644, "tokens_total": 4215, "tokens_per_sec": 45.901464227046745, "match_exact": false, "match_ast": false, "llm_equivalent": false, "llm_explanation": "The queries are not equivalent.

The user wants the top 3 customers by total spend on makeup products from Italy and Spain. Hmm. First, I need to figure out how to get the total spend per customer. But wait, the schema doesn't have a table with prices or amounts spent. Oh, right, the sales table has sale_quantity, but no price per unit. Wait, that's a problem. How can I calculate total spend without knowing the price per product?\n\nWait, maybe the product table has some info? No, looking at the schema, products have product_id, product_name, and category. No price info. The sales table has sale_quantity, but again, no price. So how can we calculate total spend? Maybe the question assumes that each product has a unit price that's the same for all, but that's not in the data. Or maybe there's a mistake in the question, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting us to use sale_quantity as the total spend? But that doesn't make sense. Unless the question is actually about total quantity sold, not total spend. But the user specifically said \"total spend\". Hmm. This is a problem. Without price data, we can't compute total spend. Maybe the question has a typo and meant total quantity? Or maybe the product table has a price column that's not mentioned here? But according to the schema provided, there's no such column.\n\nWait, looking back at the schema. The tables are customers, sales, products. Sales has sale_quantity and sale_country. Products have category. So the only way to proceed is to assume that each product has a unit price that's not stored in the database. But that's impossible. Therefore, maybe the question is actually about total quantity sold, not total spend. Maybe the user made a mistake. But since the user is asking for total spend, perhaps there's a missing table or column. But according to the given schema, there's no way to calculate total spend. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sale_quantity is the total spend? Like, maybe each unit is $1? But that's an assumption. But the user might have intended that. However, that's not clear. But given that the problem is presented as is, perhaps the user expects us to proceed with the available data, even if it's not accurate. Maybe the question is a trick question, but I need to answer based on the schema.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the sale_quantity as the total spend, even though that's not realistic. For example, if each unit is worth $1, then total spend would be sale_quantity. But that's an assumption. However, given that the user is asking for an SQL query, and the schema doesn't have price data, perhaps that's the intended approach. \n\nSo, proceeding under that assumption. Let's try to write the query. \n\nFirst, we need to join customers, sales, and products. The sales table has customer_id, product_id, sale_quantity, and sale_country. The products table has category. We need to filter products where category is 'makeup'. Also, the sale_country should be 'IT' or 'ES'. \n\nThen, for each customer, sum the sale_quantity (assuming that's the total spend). Then, order by that sum in descending order and take the top 3.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Join customers with sales on customer_id.\n2. Join with products on product_id.\n3. Filter where category = 'makeup' and sale_country in ('IT', 'ES').\n4. Group by customer_id and sum sale_quantity.\n5. Order by sum descending, limit 3.\n\nBut the question says \"total spend\", but we are using sale_quantity. However, given the schema, that's the only way. \n\nSo the SQL would be:\n\nSELECT c.customer_name, SUM(s.sale_quantity) AS total_spend\nFROM customers c\nJOIN sales s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id\nJOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id\nWHERE p.category = 'makeup' AND s.sale_country IN ('IT', 'ES')\nGROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name\nORDER BY total_spend DESC\nLIMIT 3;\n\nBut the problem is that the user said \"total spend\", but the query is using sale_quantity. However, given the schema, that's the only possible way. Unless there's a missing table or column. But according to the provided schema, that's the case. So this is the best possible answer.\n</think>\n\n```sql\nSELECT c.customer_name, SUM(s.sale_quantity) AS total_spend\nFROM customers c\nJOIN sales s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id\nJOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id\nWHERE p.category = 'makeup' AND s.sale_country IN ('IT', 'ES')\nGROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name\nORDER BY total_spend DESC\nLIMIT 3;\n```", "latency_sec": 23.599959135055542, "total_duration_sec": 23.506480775, "load_duration_sec": 0.014245457, "tokens_prompt": 399, "prompt_eval_sec": 0.095187378, "tokens_completion": 1029, "completion_eval_sec": 23.394463587, "tokens_total": 1428, "tokens_per_sec": 60.5085793508362, "match_exact": false, "match_ast": false, "llm_equivalent": false, "llm_explanation": "The queries differ in two key aspects.

The user wants the average age of clients who lost cases in the 'Personal Injury' category. Hmm, I need to figure out how to connect the tables here.\n\nFirst, there are three tables: Cases, Clients, and CaseOutcomes. The Cases table has CaseID, ClientID, and Category. Clients has ClientID, Age, and Gender. CaseOutcomes has CaseID and Outcome.\n\nSo, the plan is to join these tables. The Cases table links to Clients via ClientID. Then, CaseOutcomes links to Cases via CaseID. The Outcome needs to be 'Lost', and the Category should be 'Personal Injury'.\n\nWait, the Category in Cases is 'Personal Injury', right? So first, I need to filter Cases where Category is 'Personal Injury' and the Outcome is 'Lost'. Then, join with Clients to get the Age.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Join Cases with CaseOutcomes on CaseID where Outcome is 'Lost'.\n2. Join that result with Clients on ClientID.\n3. Filter the Cases where Category is 'Personal Injury'.\n4. Calculate the average of the Age column from the Clients table in that subset.\n\nLet me check the SQL syntax. The tables are Cases, Clients, CaseOutcomes. So the SQL would be:\n\nSELECT AVG(Clients.Age) FROM Clients\nJOIN Cases ON Clients.ClientID = Cases.ClientID\nJOIN CaseOutcomes ON Cases.CaseID = CaseOutcomes.CaseID\nWHERE Cases.Category = 'Personal Injury' AND CaseOutcomes.Outcome = 'Lost';\n\nWait, but the CaseOutcomes.Outcome is 'Lost' as per the sample data. The sample data has CaseID 701 with Outcome 'Lost', and the Case in Cases has Category 'Personal Injury'. So that would be included.\n\nBut in the sample data, there's only one case, which is 701. The client is 45, male. So the average age would be 45. But the actual SQL should handle that.\n\nI need to make sure that all the joins are correct. Also, using AVG(Age) and making sure that the WHERE clause correctly filters the cases. Also, need to check if there are any possible NULLs or other issues, but since the sample data has one entry, it's okay.\n\nSo the final SQL should be as above. Let me write that.\n</think>\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(Clients.Age) \nFROM Clients \nJOIN Cases ON Clients.ClientID = Cases.ClientID \nJOIN CaseOutcomes ON Cases.CaseID = CaseOutcomes.CaseID \nWHERE Cases.Category = 'Personal Injury' AND CaseOutcomes.Outcome = 'Lost';\n```", "latency_sec": 12.688234090805054, "total_duration_sec": 12.58535558, "load_duration_sec": 0.016525177, "tokens_prompt": 212, "prompt_eval_sec": 0.039857717, "tokens_completion": 558, "completion_eval_sec": 12.526489534, "tokens_total": 770, "tokens_per_sec": 60.686143910128976, "match_exact": false, "match_ast": false, "llm_equivalent": true, "llm_explanation": "Both queries calculate the average age of clients with 'Personal Injury' cases that resulted in 'Lost'.
